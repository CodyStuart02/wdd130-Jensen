            I was serving in Ciudad Real with one of my favorite companions, Elder Hoffman, 
            and we had a crazy experience. As a preface, in Spain missionaries go to bed at 11:30 instead 
            of 10:30 like most missions do it. It was about 11:45 and we were both in bed trying to sleep 
            when we got a really bad feeling. We got up and searched the apartment to find out what could 
            be wrong. After 15 minutes of thinking and praying for guidance, as clear as day we both felt 
            the impression to leave immediately. We got our emergency backpacks, left our apartment to go 
            to the church building and called our district leader. We ended up spending the night in the 
            chapel and we slept on some chairs we pulled together. The next morning, upon returning to the 
            apartment, we found damage on the door, right next to the frame where the lock was. Someone had 
            tried to break in the night before. I don’t know what would have happened had we stayed, but 
            what I do know is that God knew that would happened and warned us to leave. I know the Spirit 
            speaks to us to protect us and guide us, and I will never disregard a spiritual impression.

            I spent two transfers of my mission in a coastal city called Alicante. It was a fairly big city 
            with eight missionaries assigned to the two wards there, and it was a beautiful place. Still to 
            this day one of my favorite places I’ve visited. In this area came my favorite mission 
            experience. We received a referral from social media of a man by the name of Jader. He 
            expressed interest in the gospel, and we reached out to him, to find out that he was deaf. 
            So we set up an appointment with him and invited some missionaries from Seattle who were 
            assigned to an ASL speaking mission. Through the process, I started learning ASL to be able 
            to have basic conversation with him, and it was one of the most special things I’ve ever done. 
            The gospel completely changed his life. He loves the Book of Mormon, and he loves Jesus Christ. 
            He would travel from his home to the church, an hour and a half each way three times a week 
            for sacrament meetings and lessons, and continued to devour the scriptures and learn more about 
            the doctrines of the kingdom. When the time came, I learned the baptismal prayer in ASL and 
            baptized him for the remission of sins. He and I have a forever bond, and we always will. Later 
            on, the stars aligned for me to go with him to his first temple trip, and I baptized him in the 
            temple for one of his deceased ancestors. The gospel of Jesus Christ is nothing short of a 
            miracle, and the change it makes in peoples’ is indescribable.

        <h2>Mission Scripture</h2>
        <p><strong>Alma 26:12</strong><br>
            Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, 
            but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty 
            miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.
